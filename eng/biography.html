										 <p class="biography_text"><span class="style5">Gunner</span> was formed by the end of 2002 as <em><strong>Gunner Sixx</strong></em>. <span class="style8">Rodrigo Bugallo</span> (Lead Guitar) and <B>Mariano Angiolillio</B> (former drummer), who were school mates, decided to form a band with noticeable influences of 80's hard rock. To achieve it, they had asked <B>Emmanuel Blandini</B> (Rhythm Guitar), who was another friend of them from secondary school, and <B>Colo</B> (ex bass player), who was a friend of Marian's brother, to join the band.</p><img class="biography_pic" src="../images/history_thumb1.jpg" align="right" class="imgborder" />
				<p class="biography_text_with_right_picture">
			      <span class="style5">In the beginning</span>, Gunner was mainly a band of covers. Songs of Motley Crue, Poison, Bon Jovi, Europe, Skid Row were performed at every rehearsal. Although during those months they tested several singers, none of them suited fine; and that was why Roxx decided to be the lead vocalist, in addition to being the main guitarist of the band.</p>
				<p class="biography_text"><span class="style5">&bull; In early 2003:</span> with the band well-established and rehearsing regularly, they received a phone call from Marcelo Viera (guitarist of Argentine Motley Crue tribute band, called <span class="biography_strong">Louder</span>), who told them he had set up a music festival, which was going to take place at Asbury Park (Buenos Aires) on the 10th May and invited them to perform as support band of the show. There was a lot of publicity, including posters all over the streets and TV advertisements.The set-list of the show was: Cry Tough and No More Lookin' Back by Poison; Starry Eyes by Motley Crue; One Wild Night and Breakout by Bon Jovi, 3 own songs: Rockin' In The City, Sometimes and Crazy Nites; and they closed the show with the Poison cover: Look What The Cat Dragged In. This was the official live presentation of the band.Time went by and in June, Marcelo called them again, this time to play with his band at La Rocka (Buenos Aires) on the 19th of July. Everything was right, but 10 days before the show, Colo had to leave the band due to personal problems. Gunner was now without a bassist and the show was really close. It's then when <B>Hern&aacute;n Mastrogiacomo</B> appeared.</p><img class="biography_pic" src="../images/history_thumb2.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="113" class="imgborder" />
				  <p class="biography_text_with_left_picture">To this show they played a new song: 'Secrets Of Loneliness' (Lyrics by Hernán Mastrogiacomo). From that moment, the band line-up was: Roxx on lead vocals and lead guitar, Emmanuel on rhythm guitar, Hernán on bass and Mariano on drums.<br>
                  <span class="style5">&bull; 2004:</span> In march they played at Hangar (a stadium placed in Buenos Aires), opening for Kamikaze, a very well-known argentinian band. They played for the first time at La Colorada (a large pub in Buenos Aires), sharing stage with <a href="http://www.watchmen.com.ar" target="_blank" title="Watchmen">Watchmen</a>. </p><p class="biography_text">They also made a Poison Tribute at Acatraz. During that year, the band met Juan Manuel (ex-vocalist) he covered Queen's song 'Spread Your Wings'. The band kept performing live with Roxx  on vocals. It was in the show they played at Crimson (a small pub in Buenos Aires) in September, again with Louder, when the band finally introduced Juan Manuel as their brand new singer. From that moment, they made a couple of gigs with this line-up and closed the year playing at Acatraz. In this show, Mariano wasn't able to play, so they replaced him with Walter (ex drummer), who was a drummer that worked at the rehearsal room they used to go. 2004 was about to end, and, we can’t avoid mentioning the terrible tragedy that happened in a theatre of Buenos Aires, called Cromagnon, while a band was playing live. The place caught fire and almost two hundred of people died. This fact would affect all the 'unsigned bands' throughout 2005.</p><img class="biography_pic" src="../images/history_thumb3.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="113" class="imgborder">
				  <p class="biography_text"><span class="style5">&bull; 2005:</span> Started complicated. It was very difficult to find places to perform; and they decided to get the sack on Mariano, due to musical reasons. Walter was their new drummer and in March, they made a show at Alcatraz. Unluckily, Walter didn't have time to assist to rehearsals, so by the middle of the year, they changed drummer again. <B>Gustavo</B> (ex drummer), started rehearsing with Gunners and they were able to play again in October.</p><img src="../images/history_thumb4.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="113" class="imgborder">
			<br>
				 <p class="biography_text_with_right_picture"> They decided not to waste time and began to record the band's demo. Part of it was recorded at Doble B (by <a href="mailto:leadobleb@hotmail.com" title="Leandro Bordicelli">Leandro Bordicelli</a>) Recording Studios and part of it at Hernan's studio. It took them around six months to finish the recording, mixing and mastering of the demo. After the show they did at Acatraz, Gustavo left the band due to personal obligations, but Gunner continued with the recording sessions.<br></p>  
			  <p class="biography_text"><span class="style5">&bull; 2006: </span> The demo was in the heat of recording, whereas they looked for a drummer to perform live. It was then when Germán Calero (present drummer) appeared. He was a friend and a fan of the band. So, Gunner finally got established with Juan Manuel on vocals, Roxx on lead guitar, Emmanuel on rhythm guitar, Hernán on bass and Germán on drums. After the first gig they made at La Colorada in March, the demo was finished. It consists of 7 own songs: 'Desire', 'Dirty Love', 'Can't Prove it', 'Rockin' In The City', 'Secrets Of Loneliness', 'Someone To Love' and 'Over Again'. The sales of the demo were a complete success. The first 200 copies were sold out. They were  very proud and contented with the result.</p>
				
			<img src="../images/history_thumb5.jpg" align="right" class="imgborder" /><p class="biography_text_with_right_picture"> During that year, they made a lot of concerts; just to mention: two shows at La Colorada as the main band and a gig with <span class="biography_strong">Spanish Fly</span> (Van Halen's Argentine tribute band) at Blues Special Club (Buenos Aires). In September, they played again at La Colorada and closed the year, the 1st December, at Acatraz.<br>
				   By the end of 2006, Gunner were summoned to participate in a tribute Album to Europe, which will be released on 2007, both in Argentina and abroad.
